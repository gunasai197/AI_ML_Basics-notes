# what is Artificial Intelligence(AI):

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the technology that allows machines and computers to replicate human intelligence.
- Artificial intelligence (AI) enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, language understanding, and decision-making. AI can analyze vast data, detect patterns, automate repetitive work, and provide personalized recommendations

- #### real-Life Examples of AI:

1. **Google Maps**:  
    Uses AI to suggest the fastest route by analyzing traffic in real-time.
    
2. **Siri / Alexa / Google Assistant**:  
    Understands your voice and responds like a human.
    
3. **Smart Cameras**:  
    Automatically detect your face and focus when you take a photo.
    
4. **Self-driving Cars (like Tesla)**:  
    Use sensors, cameras, and AI to drive on roads without human help.
# What is Machine Learning (ML):

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where computers learn patterns from data and improve their performance over time without explicit programming

### Main types of ML:

1. **Supervised learning**: Trains models on labeled data, where both input and output are known. Used for tasks like classification and regression.

2. **Unsupervised learning:** Finds patterns or groupings in unlabeled data, commonly used for clustering and association.

3. **Reinforcement learning:** Models learn by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback through rewards or penalties to optimize future behavior.

4. **Semi-supervised learning:** Combines small amounts of labeled data with large amounts of unlabeled data.

## Examples of ML:
Supervised learning:
	1. Email spam detection
	2. Predicting house prices
	3. Image classification (distinguishing between cats and dogs)

**Unsupervised learning:**
	  1. Customer segmentation based on buying habits
	  2. Market basket analysis (finding items bought together)

**Reinforcement learning:**
	1. Training robots to walk
	2. Game-playing agents (e.g., chess programs)

## Real-world applications: ##

	1. Facial recognition
	2. Product recommendations (retail)
	3. Email automation and spam filtering
	4. Financial fraud detection

# Classification vs Regression in Machine Learning

Classification is used when you want to categorize data into different classes or groups. For example, classifying emails as "spam" or "not spam" or predicting whether a patient has a certain disease based on their symptoms. Here are some common types of classification models:

1. ***Decision Tree Classification****: Builds a tree where each node represents a test case for an attribute, and branches represent possible outcomes.
2. ***Random Forest Classification****: Uses an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions, improving accuracy by averaging the results from multiple trees.
3. ***K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)****: Classifies data points based on the 'k' nearest neighbors using feature similarity

Regression in machine learning is a supervised learning technique used to predict continuous numerical values by modeling the relationship between one or more input features (independent variables) and a target variable (dependent variable)

#### Common types include:
       - Linear regression: Assumes a straight-line relationship between inputs and output.
	   - Multiple linear regression: Uses several input variables for prediction.
	   - Polynomial regression: Can model nonlinear relationships.
