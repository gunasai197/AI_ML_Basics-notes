# what is Artificial Intelligence(AI):

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the technology that allows machines and computers to replicate human intelligence.
- #### real-Life Examples of AI:

1. **Google Maps**:  
    Uses AI to suggest the fastest route by analyzing traffic in real-time.
    
2. **Siri / Alexa / Google Assistant**:  
    Understands your voice and responds like a human.
    
3. **Smart Cameras**:  
    Automatically detect your face and focus when you take a photo.
    
4. **Self-driving Cars (like Tesla)**:  
    Use sensors, cameras, and AI to drive on roads without human help.
# What is Machine Learning (ML):

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where computers learn patterns from data and improve their performance over time without explicit programming

### Main types of ML:

1. **Supervised learning**: Trains models on labeled data, where both input and output are known. Used for tasks like classification and regression.

2. **Unsupervised learning:** Finds patterns or groupings in unlabeled data, commonly used for clustering and association.

3. **Reinforcement learning:** Models learn by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback through rewards or penalties to optimize future behavior.

4. **Semi-supervised learning:** Combines small amounts of labeled data with large amounts of unlabeled data.

## Examples of ML:
Supervised learning:
	1. Email spam detection
	2. Predicting house prices
	3. Image classification (distinguishing between cats and dogs)

**Unsupervised learning:**
	  1. Customer segmentation based on buying habits
	  2. Market basket analysis (finding items bought together)

**Reinforcement learning:**
	1. Training robots to walk
	2. Game-playing agents (e.g., chess programs)

## Real-world applications: ##

	1. Facial recognition
	2. Product recommendations (retail)
	3. Email automation and spam filtering
	4. Financial fraud detection
